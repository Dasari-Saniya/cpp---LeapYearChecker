# 📆 Leap Year Checker (C++)

## 📌 Description
A simple C++ program that checks whether a given year is a **leap year** or not.  
The program uses conditional statements to apply the standard leap year rules:
- A year is a leap year if it is **divisible by 400**, or  
- **Divisible by 4 but not by 100**.

START
INPUT year
IF (year % 400 == 0) OR (year % 4 == 0 AND year % 100 != 0)
PRINT "Leap Year"
ELSE
PRINT "Not a Leap Year"
